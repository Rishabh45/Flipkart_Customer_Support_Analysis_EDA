Problem Statement
Flipkart, as a leading e-commerce platform, handles a large volume of customer support queries across various channels. Effectively managing these queries is essential for maintaining both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. However, challenges such as delayed response times, unresolved complaints, and fluctuating satisfaction levels must be examined to enhance the overall support system. Analyzing customer support interactions can provide valuable insights into issue resolution trends, agent efficiency, and key factors influencing customer satisfaction.

Key areas of focus include:

Identifying the most common issue categories that lead to customer complaints.
Examining response times and their correlation with CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) scores.
Assessing agent performance based on resolution time and customer feedback.
Recognizing patterns that contribute to higher or lower satisfaction scores.
Understanding the impact of different support channels (chat, email, phone) on overall customer experience.
By leveraging data analytics, Flipkart can refine its customer support system, enhance agent training, and streamline issue resolution processes, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction.

Business Objective
To enhance Flipkart’s customer support system, several key business objectives must be prioritized to improve efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall service quality.

Improve Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores: Improving CSAT scores requires identifying key influencing factors and implementing corrective measures. Faster response and resolution times enhance the customer experience, while addressing common pain points ensures a smoother and more satisfying support process.
Optimize Issue Resolution Efficiency: Identifying common customer issues and refining resolution workflows enhances efficiency. Improving first-call resolution (FCR) and minimizing delays in order, return, and refund queries streamline support and boost satisfaction.
Enhance Agent Productivity & Performance: Assessing agent efficiency through handling time and customer feedback, providing targeted training for low CSAT performers, and optimizing workforce management through shift performance analysis can enhance overall support operations.
Reduce Customer Support Costs: Identify inefficiencies in query handling to reduce operational costs and improve support efficiency. Automate repetitive tasks with chatbots and self-service portals while optimizing resource allocation based on peak query hours and agent workload.
Improve Data-Driven Decision-Making: Leverage data analytics to identify trends in customer complaints and forecast demand for support services during peak sales events. Use predictive analytics to proactively resolve potential customer issues before they escalate.

plt.show()
print("\n")



Observation:

CSAT Scores are Polarized: Similar to the previous analysis, CSAT scores are concentrated at 1 and 5, indicating that customers are either highly satisfied or highly dissatisfied, with fewer neutral ratings.
Item Price is Varied Across Scores: There is no clear relationship between item price and CSAT scores. High-priced items appear across different satisfaction levels, suggesting that factors beyond price (such as customer service and product quality) influence satisfaction.
Different Communication Channels Show Similar Trends: Outcall, Inbound, and Email interactions are distributed similarly across all CSAT scores, indicating that the communication channel alone may not be a major determinant of customer satisfaction.

Observation:

CSAT Scores are Concentrated at 5 Across All Categories:Customer satisfaction scores are mostly clustered at 5, indicating high overall satisfaction. However, Returns, Cancellation, and Refund Related categories show lower scores (1 and 2), highlighting dissatisfaction in these areas, likely due to delays or unresolved issues.
Cancellation and Refund-Related Issues Have the Most Score Variation:These categories show a wider spread in ratings, with most customers giving either very high (5) or very low (1) scores, and fewer neutral responses. This suggests an inconsistent service experience, where some customers are highly satisfied while others face significant issues.
Inbound and Email Channels Show Higher Satisfaction Than Outcall:Email and Inbound interactions have higher CSAT scores, mostly concentrated at 5, while Outcall shows a wider spread with lower ratings. This suggests that customers are generally more satisfied when they initiate contact rather than receiving calls from the company.

Observation:

Higher CSAT Scores Correlate with Faster Response Times: As CSAT scores increase, response times decrease across all communication channels, indicating that quicker responses lead to higher customer satisfaction.
Email Has the Highest Response Time Variability: The yellow Email line shows the widest shaded region, meaning response times for emails vary significantly, which may impact customer satisfaction inconsistently.
Outcall Channel Has the Fastest Response Time for Low Scores: At lower CSAT scores (1-2), the Outcall channel (blue line) has a lower response time than Email and Inbound, suggesting proactive calls might be handling urgent issues faster.

print("\n")



Observation:

CSAT Scores Are Mostly Concentrated Between 2 and 5: The density plot shows that the majority of CSAT scores fall within this range, with the highest concentration around 3-4.
Negative and Extremely High Values Are Outliers: The boxplots indicate the presence of outliers, as some CSAT scores extend beyond typical values (negative and above 8), which might indicate data entry errors or anomalies.
Higher CSAT Scores Are Associated with Higher Frequencies: The density distribution suggests that as CSAT scores increase, the frequency of occurrences also rises, reinforcing that most customer feedback is skewed toward the higher end of satisfaction.
Recommendations for Enhancing Flipkart Customer Support
1. Improve Customer Satisfaction (CSAT Score):

Higher response and resolution times lead to lower CSAT scores.
Specific issue categories, such as refunds and cancellations, consistently receive lower satisfaction ratings.
Agents working evening shifts tend to have lower customer satisfaction scores.
Recommendations:
✅ Implement AI-driven chatbots to automate responses and reduce resolution time for common queries.
✅ Prioritize and expedite high-frustration cases such as refunds and cancellations.
✅ Enhance training for evening shift agents to improve efficiency and customer interactions.
Business Impact:
✔️ Improved customer satisfaction enhances retention and strengthens brand loyalty.
✔️ Quicker issue resolution minimizes negative reviews, boosting Flipkart’s reputation.

2. Reduce Response & Resolution Time:

Response time and case resolution time show a strong negative correlation with CSAT scores.
There are spikes in response time at certain time periods, suggesting staffing inefficiencies.
